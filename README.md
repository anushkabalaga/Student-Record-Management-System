This is a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) based Student Record Management System built using Java. It allows users to manage student records with basic CRUD operations — Create, Read, Update, and Delete student information. It is designed to practice real-world data structure usage, such as ArrayLists in Java.

View Students: View all students information.
Update Student: Modify an existing student's details.
Delete Student: Remove a student's record from the system.
Exit: Exit the application.

Technologies Used:
Java: Programming language used for the application.
